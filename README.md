# social-_network-_API

The application is meant to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
